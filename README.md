# ELEC70048_HWSW_Verification

## Hardware

### GPIO - TODO

- [ ] Verification Checklist
- [ ] Parity Bit inplementation
    - [] Fault injection
    - [] Output PARITYERR 'Set to a ‘1’ every time a parity error is detected'
    - [] Input PARITYSEL 'Parity selection input pin;
                            Odd parity if PARITYSEL = 1,
                            Even parity if PARITYSEL = 0'
- [] Function Verification
    - [] Add Assertions
    - [] Test with JasperGold
- [] Unit Level Tests
    - [x] Get GPIO Read/Write to work for initial tests
    - [] Implement transaction class to randomize
    - [] Implement Generator class
    - [] Implement Driver class
- [] Top coverage with CPU implementation 
 
### VGA - TODO

- [] Verification Checklist
- [] Dual Lock-Step Configuration of VGA Peripheral
